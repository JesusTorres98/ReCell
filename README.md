# ReCell
Utilized historical data of a refurbished and used phones company to develop a dynamic pricing strategy.
  * Explored the dataset and extracted insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  * Developed a final statsmodel by reducing multicollinearity and step-wise regression to eliminate non-statistically significant predictors.
  * The model explains 99% of the variation in the data and can predict within 1.1 euros of the used phone price. 

*Key skills: EDA, Linear Regression, Linear Regression assumptions, Business insights and recommendations*
